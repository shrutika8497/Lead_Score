# Lead_Score
The Lead score case study involves developing a logistic regression model to predict the probability of lead conversion for X Education.

This repository contains the code and files related to the lead score case study. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify potential leads for conversion. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the "Leads.csv" file.

**Project Structure**

**Code:** This directory contains the Python script "lead_score.ipynb" which includes the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

**Data:** This directory contains the "Leads.csv" file, which is the dataset used in this case study, and "Lead Data Dictionary.xlsx" contains column description.

**Presentation:** This directory contains the PowerPoint presentation "Lead_Score_Case_Study.pdf" summarizing the case study and its findings.

**README.md:** This file provides an overview of the case study, project structure, and instructions for running the code.


The Main objective of this case study is to improve the conversion rate of incoming leads. 
An EdTech company named as X Education needs help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein we have to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. X education is targeting the lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
